# Todoist Full-Width Override
This is a simple CSS override for Todoist.com that allows for a full-width interface. This is designed for use in [Stylus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne), but includes both the Stylus export and raw CSS for use in any restyling tool.
